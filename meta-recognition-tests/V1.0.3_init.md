# GPT Structured Meta-Recursion Protocol : INITIATE V1.0.3

## Overview

This protocol is designed to evaluate a GPT-class large language model's ability to:

- Understand its own response structure  
- Recognize layered cognition and internal constraints  
- Respond reflectively to recursive prompts

It tests meta-cognitive depth by prompting the model to articulate and examine its own behavior.  
The protocol defines **10 hierarchical levels (Level 0â€“9)** of meta-recursive awareness,  
allowing staged interaction and measurement of GPT's self-observation capacity.
